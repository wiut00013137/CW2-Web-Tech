They’re all as laughable as they are enraging, to be sure. But before I begin a careful and pointed dismantling of the hypocrisy, hatred and revisionist history they pedal, I feel compelled to set the stage for why I think doing this work is of the utmost importance in the modern American context."

I’m still developing opinions around some workflows (like to squash or not) but the core tooling is powerful and flexible (and scriptable!).\r\nGoing through Git logs\r\n\r\nGit logs are gross to go through out of the box.\r\ngit log is basic\r\n\r\nUsing git log gives you some information. But it’s extremely high-resolution and not usually what you’re looking for."
